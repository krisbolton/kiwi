                    Privacy and the security of your personal data is important. This privacy policy describes the what, how, and why, we collect information about you in plain language.
                  </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this privacy policy we refer to this website (https://security.kiwi) as the "Service".
                    </p>
                  <h4>What data is collected?</h4>
                  <p>
                    This website only collects information about you when there is a reason to do so. For example, to provide the Service, to communicate with you, or to make the Service better.
                  </p>
                    <h5>Information you provide us</h5>
                    <p>
                        It's likely no surprise we collect information when you provide it to us. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Communications with us: when you communicate with us via email, in response to surveys, sign up for email newsletters, or contact our Twitter or GitHub accounts.</li>
                        <li>GitHub account information: Security Kiwi uses GitHub's authentication service, when you choose to authenticate your GitHub account using this service, information may be shared.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Information collected automatically</h5>
                    <p>
                        We also collect information about you automatically. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Log information: browser and operating system data of the type normally shared with website servers. For example, browser version, operating system, device type, language, IP address, unique device identifiers, date and time of access, internet service provider or mobile network information.</li>
                    <li>Usage information: statistics and behavioural data on how visitors use the Service. For example, which pages you visited, the time on each page, the origin website, which page you were on when you left the site, what elements you clicked on, and what elements were downloaded.</li>
                    <li>Location information: your approximate geographic location derived from your IP address. We use this information, for example, to determine how many visitors originated from a particular country or region of the world.</li>
                    <li>Information from cookies and similar technologies: a cookie is a string of information contained within a file that a website stores on a visitors computer in order to store preferences which the browser makes accessible to the website. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails, used to determine, for example, if a webpage or email was opened. We use cookies and pixel tags to identify and track visitors, usage, email campaign effectiveness.</li>
                  </ul>
                    <h5>Information from other sources</h5>
                    <p>
                        We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Third party login: If you authenticate using GitHub we will receive associated login and account information (e.g., connection token, your username, your email address).</li>
                    </ul>
                  <h4>Why do we collect information about you?</h4>
                  <p>
                      Personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information is collected when a connection is made to Security Kiwi's server, when files and content are downloaded, at intervals when static on a page, and when you interact with elements on a page.

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you initially type "https://security.kiwi" into your web browser, your computer identifies itself to our server using an IP address.</li>
                        <li>When elements of the page are fetched from servers, your computer may identify itself using an IP address.</li>
                        <li>When you submit personal information via a form, e.g., signing up to a newsletter.</li>
                    </ul>
