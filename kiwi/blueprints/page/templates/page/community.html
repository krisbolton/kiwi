                      All of the courses and modules available on Security Kiwi are learner-friendly; they use plain language, code snippets, graphics, and video which appeal to the range of learning styles. In addition, I make myself available to answer questions via <a href="">GitHub Discussions</a> and encourage the community to assist eachother.

                        I imagine its polite to introduce myself here. Hi, I'm Kris Bolton. Security Kiwi was created as the result of my undergraduate and graduate education in computer science and cyber security and the lack of information available outside of academia and the private sector on machine learning for security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Security Kiwi now contains much more content than just machine learning material and has grown to include content to encourage new people into information security and provides people with the oppurtunity to learn intermediate and advanced skills in interesting areas such as computer science, programming, and machine learning. I plan to expand this content to include areas such as information security policy, standards, and risk.

                    </p>
                  <h4>The Vision</h4>
                    <p>
                        The vision for Security Kiwi is a high-quality resource for those interested in learning about information security and obtaining new skills. I have and will continue to put a great deal of time and resources into Security Kiwi to make it an excellent resource. Security Kiwi is now a fully-fledged Flask web application capable of providing a significantly better learner experience than the previous static website, and continues to improve over time with new feautres and content.

                        If you find the content useful, I would greatly apprecaite if you considered becoming a <a href="">GitHub Sponsor</a> from $5 per month. Your sponsorship allows me to dedicate more time and resources for content and site development and helps pay for graphics, servers, content distribution networks (CDN), privacy-first analytics (no Google Analytics), and more.
                    </p>
                  <h4>The Community</h4>
                  <p>
                      Another aim is to foster a community around learning, in particular the subjects covered by Security Kiwi. I encourage you start, follow, and reply to discussions on the Security Kiwi <a href="">GitHub Discussions</a> page, engage on Twitter, and on <a href="">0x00Sec</a>, an active forum for the infosec community.
                  </p>
