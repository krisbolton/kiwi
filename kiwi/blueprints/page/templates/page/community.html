                      All of the courses and modules available on Security Kiwi are learner-friendly; they use plain language, code snippets, graphics, and video which appeal to the range of learning styles. In addition, users are encouraged to ask and answer questions on <a href="">GitHub Discussions</a> to build a helpful community of learners.

                        I imagine it's polite to introduce myself here. Hi, I'm Kris Bolton. Security Kiwi was created as the result of my undergraduate and graduate education in computer science and cyber security and the lack of information available outside of academia and the private sector on machine learning for security.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Security Kiwi now contains more than just machine learning material and has grown to include content to encourage new people into information security and provide people with the oppurtunity to aquire knowledge and skills in topics across information security . I plan to expand this content to include areas such as information security policy, standards, risk, and many more.

                    </p>
                  <h4>The Vision</h4>
                    <p>
                        The vision for Security Kiwi is a high-quality resource for those interested in learning about information security and obtaining new skills. I have and will continue to put a great deal of time and resources into Security Kiwi to make it an excellent resource. Security Kiwi is now a fully-fledged Flask web application capable of providing a significantly better learner experience than the previous static website, and continues to improve over time with new feautres and content.

                        If you find the content useful, I would greatly apprecaite if you considered becoming a <a href="">GitHub Sponsor</a> from $5 per month. Your sponsorship allows me to dedicate more time and resources for content and site development and helps pay for maintenance and development: servers, graphics, content distribution networks (CDN), privacy-first analytics (no Google Analytics), and more.
                    </p>
                  <h4>The Community</h4>
                  <p>
                      A further aim is to foster a community around learning, in particular the subjects covered by Security Kiwi. I encourage you start, follow, and reply to discussions on the Security Kiwi <a href="">GitHub Discussions</a> page, engage on Twitter, and popular forums: <a href="https://updatedsecurity.com">UpdatedSecurity</a>, and <a href="https://0x00sec.org">0x00Sec</a>, two active forum for the infosec community.
                  </p>
